Thanks for using webmaster!
There are some important things which you need to know -
1. Extract the folders and files from zip file in a folder.
2. Save the code copied from webmaster as 'index.html' in the same folder where other files are also there.
3. Don't change the path of the files.
4. Keep all the files and folder in the same folder. If you want, you can change the main directory. 

Your website is ready to use!
Open index.html to view your website. Now if you want you can upload it on your hosting and domain! :)
